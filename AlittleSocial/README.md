# AlittleSocial
Small django project showing how to add comments feature in a social-media-web project
I decided to build this little project on a livestream on a discord voice channel where i taught some guys how linking comment models to post models works .

Feel free to plaly around with this project but do not forget to star this repo :)
I am waiting for pull requests concerning redesigning the frontend or turning the app into something more usefull ;)
